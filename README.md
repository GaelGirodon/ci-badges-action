This action generates badges (as JSON files) from Go, JUnit, Cobertura, JaCoCo
and LCOV test and coverage reports (most test runners and code coverage tools,
including Mocha, Jest, PHPUnit, c8, Istanbul/nyc, and more, support at least
one of these formats) and upload them to a Gist to make them available to
Shields through the endpoint feature with (almost) zero configuration.

## Usage

Create a [Gist](https://gist.github.com) and an
[access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (with the `gist` scope)
and store the access token in your repository secrets.

Add the action to your [workflow](./.github/workflows/main.yml#L27-L30) (after
running tests, as reports must be available in the current working directory):

```yaml
uses: gaelgirodon/ci-badges-action@v1
with:
  gist-id: <gist-id>
  token: ${{ secrets.GIST_TOKEN }}
```

Each generated badge JSON file is uploaded to your Gist and is available via:
`https://gist.githubusercontent.com/{user}/{gist-id}/raw/{repo}-[{ref}-]{format}-{type}.json`,
e.g. `.../myproject-cobertura-coverage.json`.

This URL can be used with [Shields Endpoint](https://shields.io/badges/endpoint-badge)
to generate the badge SVG image: `https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={url}`.
The usual query parameters (`style`, `label`, ...) can be used to further
customize the badge.

## Inputs

| Name      | Required | Default         | Description                                             |
| --------- | :------: | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gist-id` |    ✔️     |                 | The unique identifier of the Gist                       |
| `token`   |    ✔️     |                 | GitHub REST API access token (with the `gist` scope)    |
| `prefix`  |          | Repository name | Filenames prefix                                        |
| `ref`     |          | `false`         | Include the short ref name (branch or tag) in filenames |

## Badges

This action loads reports, extracts key data and generates JSON files following
the Shields schema, instead of directly generating SVG images, to allow taking
advantage of Shields customization features (through the query string).

### Tests

![tests](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?style=flat-square&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2FGaelGirodon%2F715c62717519f634185af0ebde234992%2Fraw%2Frepo-go-tests.json)

This badge displays the number of passed, failed and skipped tests extracted
from test report(s).

```json
{"schemaVersion":1,"label":"tests","message":"3 passed","color":"brightgreen"}
```

### Coverage

![coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?style=flat-square&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2FGaelGirodon%2F715c62717519f634185af0ebde234992%2Fraw%2Frepo-go-coverage.json)

This badge displays the percentage of covered lines extracted from a coverage
report.

```json
{"schemaVersion":1,"label":"coverage","message":"96%","color":"brightgreen"}
```

## Report formats

This action supports multiple report formats with their conventional or most
popular configurations.

Only matched report formats will get a file uploaded to the Gist.

### Go

Write the verbose test output (`>` or `tee`) with coverage enabled to a single
`test*.{out,txt}` file next to the `go.mod` file:

- `RUN`, `PASS`, `FAIL` and `SKIP` flags will be used to count tests
- The last percentage will be used as the coverage value

`go tool cover -func=cover.out` output may be appended to the above file to make
sure the last percentage is the global coverage value.

➡️ `{repo}-[{ref}-]go-tests.json`<br>
➡️ `{repo}-[{ref}-]go-coverage.json`

### JUnit

Write test report(s) to file(s) matching:

- `**/TEST-*.xml`
- `**/report.xml`
- `**/*test*.xml`
- `**/*junit*.xml`

This is the default format and location with JUnit, but most test runners
support this format too, natively or using an additional reporter:

- **Maven**: `mvn test` → `target/{surefire,failsafe}-reports/TEST-*.xml`
- **Gradle**: `gradle test` → `build/test-results/test/**/TEST-*.xml`
- **Node.js**: `node --test --test-reporter=junit --test-reporter-destination=report.xml`
- **Mocha**: `mocha --reporter mocha-junit-reporter` → `test-results.xml`
- **Jest**: `jest --reporters="jest-junit"` → `junit.xml`
- **Deno**: `deno test --junit-path=report.xml`
- **PHPUnit**: `phpunit --log-junit report.xml`

The number of tests (total, failed and skipped) will be extracted from
top-level `<testsuite>` tags, from all matching and valid report files.

➡️ `{repo}-[{ref}-]junit-tests.json`

### Cobertura

Write the coverage report to a file matching:

- `**/*cobertura*.xml`
- `**/*coverage*.xml`

This is the default format and location with Cobertura, but most code coverage
tools support this format too, natively or using an additional reporter:

- **c8**: `c8 --reporter cobertura [...]` → `coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml`
- **nyc**: `nyc --reporter cobertura [...]` → `coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml`
- **PHPUnit**: `phpunit --coverage-cobertura coverage.xml`

The coverage will be extracted from the `line-rate` attribute of the
`<coverage>` tag, from the first matching and valid report file.

➡️ `{repo}-[{ref}-]cobertura-coverage.json`

### JaCoCo

Write the coverage report to a file matching:

- `**/*jacoco*.xml`
- `**/*coverage*.xml`

This is the default format and location with JaCoCo, but some code coverage
tools may support this format too.

The coverage will be extracted from the last `<counter>` tag with type `LINE`,
from the first matching and valid report file.

➡️ `{repo}-[{ref}-]jacoco-coverage.json`

### LCOV

Write the coverage report to a file matching:

- `**/lcov.*`
- `**/*.lcov`

This is the default format and location with LCOV, but some code coverage
tools support this format too, natively or using an additional reporter:

- **c8**: `c8 --reporter lcov [...]` → `coverage/lcov.info`
- **Deno**: `deno test --coverage=cov_profile && deno coverage cov_profile --lcov --output=cov_profile.lcov`

The coverage will be computed using `LF` and `LH` keys, from the first
matching and valid report file.

➡️ `{repo}-[{ref}-]lcov-coverage.json`

### Mutation

Write the mutation report to a file matching:

- `**/mutations.xml`
- `**/mutation.json`

This is the default format and location with Cobertura, but most code coverage
tools support this format too, natively or using an additional reporter:

- **Maven**: `mvn org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage` → `target/pit-reports/mutations.xml`
- **Stryker with Npm**: `stryker run stryker.conf.json` → `reports/mutation/mutation.json`


The mutation will be extracted from the `status` attribute of the
`<mutation>` tag from xml file or `status` attribute from json file.

➡️ `{repo}-[{ref}-]mutation-mutation.json`

## Notes

Storing badge JSON files on a Gist may seem tedious, but:

- An intermediate storage solution is required until GitHub Actions supports
  publishing test and coverage data natively (as GitLab CI and Azure Pipelines
  do);
- Storing generated files next to the source code in the Git repository (even
  on another branch) might seem like a bad practice for some people;
- Generating JSON files instead of SVG files allows for better SoC (Separation
  of Concerns) and therefore easier customization using Shields features.
